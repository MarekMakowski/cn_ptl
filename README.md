# cn_ptl: China Power-To-Liquid technologies model
Repository for the China PTL model developed by Jinyang Zhou during IIASA YSSP-21. This repository shall replace the marek-iiasa/ptl_jz repository. MM will gradually move the needed elements to the ptl_jz to the cn_prl.

The cn_prl has the hierarchical branch structure. The current work should be now committed to working (feature) sub-branches of the develop/prototype branch.

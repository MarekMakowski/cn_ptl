This folder shall be used for the Python code used for generating the elements
of the model. It is initialized with msg01.py, which was copied from the ptl_jz
repo, and later modified to use the relocated and renamed data files.

Please add to  the .gitignore file (or create such a file in this dir) the line:
.idea
This is necessary to refrain from committing the local pycharm environment to the repo.

The consecutive exploratory versions of the py code are in files: msg??.py (by Marek)
and msg??jz.py (by Jinyang), as well as in outp1.py (by Marek); the latter processes
the solutions stored in the output.gdx files generated by MCMA.

The ptl_01.py is the early prototype of utility supporting all modeling stages
(model generation, single-criterion optimization, reporting) based on the
message_ix local db. It therefore support initial model verification but is not
suitable for MCMA.

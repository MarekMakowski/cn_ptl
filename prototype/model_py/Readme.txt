This folder shall be used for the Python code used for generating the elements
of the model. It is initialized with msg01.py, which was copied from the ptl_jz
repo, and later modified to use the relocated and renamed data files.

Please add to  the .gitignore file (or create such a file in this dir) the line:
.idea
This is necessary to refrain from committing the local pycharm environment to the repo.

The first commit contains copy of msg01.py named msg01jz.py to be used by Jinyang
for further modifications.

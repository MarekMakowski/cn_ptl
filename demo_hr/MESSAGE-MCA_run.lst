  25  * Model run script
  26  * ================
  27  * | This page is generated from the auto-documentation
  28  * | in ``model/MESSAGE_run.gms``.
  29  *
  30  * This is |MESSAGEix| framework version 1.0. The version number must match the version number of the ixToolbox
  31  * used for exporting data and importing results.
  32  *
  33  * This file contains the workflow of a standard MESSAGE run. It can be called:
  34  *  - either through the file ``MESSAGE_master.gms``, where the datastructure name and other options
  35  *    are stated explicitly, or
  36  *  - directly from the command line, with the datastructure name and other options specific as command line parameters,
  37  *    e.g. :literal:`gams MESSAGE_run.gms --data\=\"<name>\"`.
  38  *
  39  * The data file (in gdx format) must be located in the ``model/data`` folder
  40  * and be named in the format ``MSGdata_<name>.gdx``. Upon completion of the GAMS execution,
  41  * a results file ``MSGoutput_<name><comment>.gdx`` will be written to the folder ``model/output``.
  42  * Here, ``<comment>`` is an additional identifier provided as a command line parameter
  43  * (e.g., for keeping gdx dumps across different runs of the same data file).
  44  ***
  45   
  46  * set # as end-of-line comment; all text after # is ignored
  47  * (for proper display in GAMS IDE, this needs to be specified in the options, too)

  55  * a datastructure name is mandatory to load the gdx file - abort the run if not specified or file does not exist
